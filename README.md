# This is a Work In Progress project!

## How to use the extension
- Check Node.js and npm requirements from https://developers.raycast.com/basics/getting-started
- Clone the repo locally
- Go into the new folder and execute `npm install && npm run dev`. Raycast should open with and show you the new extension. The extension will continue to work even after killing the process run by `npm`
- In the future, to update the extension, pull from origin/main and re-run `npm install && npm run dev`
